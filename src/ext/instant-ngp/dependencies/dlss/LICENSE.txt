NVIDIA RTX SDKs LICENSE

This license is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA")
and governs the use of the NVIDIA RTX software development kits, including the
DLSS SDK, NGX SDK, RTXGI SDK, RTXDI SDK and/or NRD SDK, if and when made
available to you under this license (in each case, the "SDK"). This license can
be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which
the SDK is used. If you are under the legal age of majority, you must ask your
parent or legal guardian to consent to this license. If you are entering this
license on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you
have legal authority and "you" will mean the entity you represent. By using the
SDK, you affirm that you have reached the legal age of majority, you accept the
terms of this license, and you take legal and financial responsibility for the
actions of your permitted users. 

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
license, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices
or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license and the terms in the supplement
attached, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license,
without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this license)
to: 

(a) Install and use the SDK,

(b) Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the
SDK, and

(c) Distribute any software and materials within the SDK, other than developer
tools provided for your internal use, as incorporated in object code format into

the license grant, license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA's intellectual
property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy,
security and legal rights of your application users. 

(d) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution
or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this license, and
to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to the distributed portions
of the SDK. 

3. AUTHORIZED USERS. You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or
of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to
perform work on your behalf. If you are an academic institution you may allow
users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the SDK
from your secure network. You are responsible for the compliance with the terms
of this license by your authorized users. 

4. LIMITATIONS. Your license to use the SDK is restricted as follows:

(a) You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright
or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK. 

(b) Except as expressly provided in this license, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any

NVIDIA.

(d) You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation,
encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in
the SDK. 

(e) You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject
to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a
condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be: (i)
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of
making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.

(f) Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use
the SDK with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or
application can reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury,
death, or catastrophic loss. Examples include use in avionics, navigation,
military, medical, life support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does
not design, test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall
not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
damages arising from such uses. 

(g) You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates,
and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors,
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to
attorney's fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification)
arising out of or related to your use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
license, or not in compliance with its terms. 

5. UPDATES. NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or
other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate
governing terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in
this license. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally
maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes
that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.

6. PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS. SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early
access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain
errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy,
availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. You may use a pre-release SDK version at your own
risk, understanding that these versions are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to make available a
commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time
without liability.

7. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS. The SDK may include third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in proprietary notices
accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent there is a conflict between the terms
in this license and the third-party license terms, the third-party terms control
only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. 

8. OWNERSHIP. 

8.1 NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK not
expressly granted to you under this license. NVIDIA and its suppliers hold all
rights, title and interest in and to the SDK, including their respective
intellectual property rights. The SDK is copyrighted and protected by the laws
